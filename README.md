### Testing
Please write some [HTTP Tests](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/http-tests) to test various functionality.

Some initial tests have been added to `tests/Feature/HttpTest`. 
There are a handful of incomplete tests in here which will need implementing.

Feel free to write additional tests for any other functionality that may require it.

Don't worry about hitting 100% test coverage.

You can run the PHPUnit test suite with `composer test`
